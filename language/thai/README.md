## Description

This repository contains a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file for efficiently learning the 3,000 most frequently used Thai words. The dataset is designed to be imported into [Memozora](https://memozora.com), a flashcard application for effective learning and memorization.

## Features

- Words are ordered from easier to more difficult.
- Each entry includes a pair of Thai example sentences with English translations.
- All example sentences use words you've already learned plus one new word, ensuring gradual vocabulary building.

## File Format

The TSV file is structured as follows:

1. Thai word
2. English translation
3. Thai example sentence
4. English translation of the example sentence
5. Additional notes or context (if applicable)

ไป	to go	ฉันไปโรงเรียน	I go to school
กิน	to eat	เธอกินข้าว	She eats rice
```
